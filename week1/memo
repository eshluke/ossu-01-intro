[Thoughts on the Class]
- In lecture, it was a nice approach to compare C syntax with scratch block components side by side.
- Worth-to-remember concepts from the lecture: Overflow (finite memory), Floating-point imprecision, Abstraction
- It was my first time working in a cloud environment, and I could at least feel how Docker can make life easier.
- Impressed by well-configured working environment: automated pset self-checking, submission, updating workspace, etc. (Automation!)

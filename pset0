Problem Set 0 requires you to make a simple program with Scratch.
This is a link to my work : https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/145200747/

It was my first time working with Scratch, and it was more enjoyable than I expected.

There would be many features of Scratch that I don't know about, but here are my first impressions of Scratch..
- Goods: Enjoyable, Easy to learn, Quite many tools (code components, images, sounds, etc) are available to work with.
- Bads: You have to make program with mouse clicks, No inheritance (i.e. duplications occur), No "break" clause for loops
